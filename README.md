# AES-Project
#Created by TANAY SARAF
An advanced encryption standard based project.
Use Cipher Encryption
Securely transfer files without any risk of data leakage.
This is an GUI based application.
As soon as the user runs the application , user gets the option to encrypt or decrypt the image.
If you go on encrypt option ,you'll be uploading the image that needs to be encrypted , also you will be setting a key to lock the image,  then the program uses Cipher encyption to encrypt the image , the output will be a distroted image which under no circumstances can be understood by any machine or human. 
To decrypt the image the person must have the same key which was used to encrypt the image, using this the person will upload the encrypted image and enter the key and will get the original message as the output.
This will help in minimising the problem of data theft and leaks of other sensitive information. The file that we obtained after encryption is very safe and no one can steal data from this file. So, this file can be sent on a network without worrying.

Just some fact: If brute force method is used to decrypt the encrypted image , it will take more than 30 years of attempt.
